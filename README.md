# todolist
This is my very basic todolist app in Reactjs without backend.
to run it:

1. git clone
2. cd to the todolist reop
3. install all 3rd party lib. by typing command: npm i or npm install
4. run vite by typing command: npm run dev
5. use the link to open an app in browser and start using it.
